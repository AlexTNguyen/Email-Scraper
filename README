ScrapeEmails.java - README
Alex Nguyen

DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------
A command-line program that takes in a domain and prints out all the email addresses found on 
any of the discoverable pages of the domain.
 
HOW IT WORKS
-----------------------------
It utilizes the Jsoup library to parse the html of the URLs given to it. 
The library uses RegEx to find the links and email addresses found on a page. 
The user provides a domain, which is added to a stack of URLs to be searched. 
Every page found on the stack will first be parsed for links to also be added onto the stack.
Every page on the stack will also be parsed for email addresses, which are printed. 
When the stack is empty, the process is complete. 

HOW TO SETUP/RUN
-----------------------------
Add the jsoup-1.9.2.jar file to the classpath when compiling:
	On Linux: 
		javac -cp .:jsoup-1.9.2.jar ScrapeEmails.java
		java -cp .:jsoup-1.9.2.jar ScrapeEmails [domain name]

Alternatively, if you're using an IDE, you can add the .jar file to your External Jars.

NOTES
-----------------------------
The program currently throws an error when it finds a link that is infinitely redirected.
